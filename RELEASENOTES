v0.2.0
 - Circuit evaluation now allows pure-state vector inputs
 - Circuit evaluation now utilizes time step sequences. Still defaults
     to the complete circuit. Single time values will only evaluate that step.
     any sequence (must be squence) in [1,|circuit|] can now be evaluated by
     passing that sequnce as the time argument.

v0.1.2
 - Evaluate Circuits operating on pure-states (vector form) using the
    elementary gates I,X,Z,Y,S,T,H,CNot.
 - Complete and partial measurements in the stantard basis
 - Input to n qubit circuit can be n bit binary number as row vector
    or integer from [0,2^n).
 - Circuits can be partial evaluated from step 1 to t<|circuit|. 
 - Circuits described by simple cell array which is interpreted by evalCircuit
 - Can compute density operator form of pure-states
 - Can compute partial trace of density operators
 - Checked version of key operations evaluated pre-conditions of inputs where
   unchecked versions do not. 
 - Easy computation of standard basis vectors and matrix representations of 
   elementary operators. 

v1.0.0
 - Complete rewrite with EDSL focus:
 -- Circuit descriptors are compiled to circuit objects via buildCircuit
 -- Simulation of circuit objects can be carried out via simulate
 -- Simulation can be done w.r.t. nested depth and time steps thus allowing
    user specified steps and step by step simulation
 - See examples for example usage and discussion of various features.
