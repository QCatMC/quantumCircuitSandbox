## Usage: [y,t] = sim(gate,in,bits,currd,dlim,currt,tlim)
## 
##  simulate the action of a @QASMcNot 'gate' on pure state
##  'in' in a system of size 'bits'.  The current simulation depth is
##  currd and dlim is the user specified simulation depth limit.
##  Similarly, currt is the current simulation time step (w.r.t to
##  dlim) and tlim is the user specified number of steps to simulate.
##  The simulation returns two results, the pure state y that results
##  from the operator and the current time step t.
